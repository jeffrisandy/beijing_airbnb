## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Beijing AirBnb listing data from 2016 to better understanding in finding the most value listing:

1. Where is the most value neighbourhood ?
2. Where is the most positive vibes neighbourhood ?
3. How to choose and evaluate listings for the most value for price ?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There  is only 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@jeffrisandy/where-to-stay-in-beijing-airbnb-795bb184acd7).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to AirBnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the AirBnb link available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
